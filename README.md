Little library of my unused code

Often times, I spend a lot of time writing code which turns out to be not used for various reasons : the approach might not lead to anything useful, there might be better ways of doing the same thing, or the problem I was trying to solve is not a problem anymore ... anyway, this is a collection ground for code which is not needed.

1. [CT_county_google_heatmap.ipynb] (CT_county_google_heatmap.ipynb): 
  This was part of the project to analyze the drug mortality data from Connecticut. It generates a heatmap.

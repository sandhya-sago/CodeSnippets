Little library of my unused code

Often times, I spend a lot of time writing code which turns out to be not used for various reasons : the approach might not lead to anything useful, there might be better ways of doing the same thing, or the problem I was trying to solve is not a problem anymore ... anyway, this is a collection ground for code which is not needed.
